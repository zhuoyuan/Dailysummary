### A linux API about Cpu-Affinity

CPU Affinity means that the process want run itself on certain cpus. The Linux process sheduling algorithm has a important property: Soft CPU Affinity which means processes don't alway migrating form one cpu to another. It is what we want.

Linux provide some API(homologous, Hard CPU Affinity) to let users bind process to certain cpus, carefull that the affinity will pass to their childs.

*sched_setaffinity() : for modiry mask*

*sched_getaffinity() : for look up mask*

### Why use CPU-Affinity

- Keep high Cache hit
- Reduce the probability of Process-Migrating
