### Direct IO

Generally, when we open a file with fopen(), the default mode is BUFFERED, that means the file data will be first copy to the page cache which controled by the kernel, and when we use fread(), the file data not copy from disk, but from page cache, the data will be copyed from kernel space to user space. Can we copy the data directly from the disk? the anster is yes, we can use the open syscall, and use O_DIRECT mode, then the file I/O is done directly to/from user space buffers from/to disk. If your application is just copy the file and don't modify it ,the O_DIRECT mode will get a better performance.

Be carefull when you use O_DIRECT mode, The alignment of recieve buffer and file offset must all be multiples of the logical block size of the file system, generally is 4096, you may write like this:
```
use " dumpe2fs /dev/sda6|grep -i "block size" " to query logical block size of you system, eg. 4096

typedef char _aligned_char __attribute__ ((aligned (8192)));
_aligned_char buffer[4096];
```
