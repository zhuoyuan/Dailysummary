### Direct IO

Generally, when we open a file with fopen(), the default mode is BUFFERED, that means the file data will be first copy to the page cache which controled by the kernel, and when we use fread(), the file data not copy from disk, but from page cache, the data will by copyed from kernel space to user space. Can we copy the data directly from the disk? the anster is yes, we can use the open syscall, and use O_DIRECT mode, then the file data will not be copyed to page cache for buffered. If your application is just copy the file and don't modify it ,the O_DIRECT mode will get a better performance.
