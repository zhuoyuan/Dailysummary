### Build my first simple Git Server with SSH on Ubuntu

In the past few days, we(a two-people-term) want to manage our code more efficient, we just send or recieve patches form email before, and we two don't think it is a good ideas. With the project incresing quitly, we have to send email more and more frequently, Then I decide to build a small-scale git server, then we can manage out code more efficient and convenient.

##### **First, you need install git and ssh-server**
```
sudo apt-get install git
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
then start the ssh server : /etc/init.d/ssh restart
```

##### **Create a git user for running git-service**
```
sudo adduser git
```

##### **Collect pub key of your term group**
```
touch /home/git/.ssh
then add all termers' pub-key into this file, one key one line
```

##### **Create a empty git rep**
```
sudo git init --bare hellogit.git
```

##### **For safety, forbid shell login**
```
vim /etc/passwd
```
Find out
```
git:x:1001:1001:git,,,:/home/git:/bin/bash
```
Modify:
```
git:x:1001:1001:git,,,:/home/git:/usr/bin/git-shell
```

##### **Now, you can clone the hellogit.git**
```
git clone git@server:/path/hellogit.git
Cloning into 'hellogit'...
warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository.
```
After this, you can push and pull you code, enjoy it.

*Hint: this method is just for small term(3-8 people), if your term has hundreds of people, it is not a property choice*
