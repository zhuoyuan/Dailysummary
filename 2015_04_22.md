### Be carefull about open big file!

Today, when I attempt to open a file about 2.4GB, I get a NULL return

```
    #include <stdio.h>

    FILE *fp = fopen("Thepure.y4m", "rb"); /* Largefile >= 2GB */
    perror("Error Info:");

    Error Info: Value too large for defined data type
```
I guess on 32bit system, int <= (2 ^ 31 - 1), then when I want to open a File more than 2GB, it will failed, so I run the same program on a 64bit system, it returns the right FILE* and works well. Then I decide to look up stdio.h, I see some code like this:
```
#ifndef __USE_FILE_OFFSET64
/* Open a file and create a new stream for it.

   This function is a possible cancellation point and therefore not
   marked with __THROW.  */
extern FILE *fopen (__const char *__restrict __filename,
            __const char *__restrict __modes) __wur;
/* Open a file, replacing an existing stream with it.

   This function is a possible cancellation point and therefore not
   marked with __THROW.  */
extern FILE *freopen (__const char *__restrict __filename,
              __const char *__restrict __modes,
              FILE *__restrict __stream) __wur;
#else
# ifdef __REDIRECT
extern FILE *__REDIRECT (fopen, (__const char *__restrict __filename,
                 __const char *__restrict __modes), fopen64)
  __wur;
extern FILE *__REDIRECT (freopen, (__const char *__restrict __filename,
                   __const char *__restrict __modes,
                   FILE *__restrict __stream), freopen64)
  __wur;
# else
#  define fopen fopen64
#  define freopen freopen64
# endif
#endif
```
then I do a experment, on 64bits system, the __USE_FILE_OFFSET64 is defined, but on on 32bits system, it not. then I change my code:
```
    #define __USE_FILE_OFFSET64
    #include<stdio.h>

    FILE *fp = fopen("Thepure.y4m", "rb"); /* Largefile >= 2GB */
    perror("Error Info:");

    Error Info: Value too large for defined data type
```
the same error info, there must be something wrong, when I use *gcc -E test.c | vim -*, I find the fopen64 is not be defined, it is still fopen, I go back to stdio.h and find that it contains a head file named features.h, and this file contains a row at the top position:
```
#undef  __USE_FILE_OFFSET64
```
so my code don't works because it clear the MACRO, I read features.h, and find this codes:
```
#if defined _FILE_OFFSET_BITS && _FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64
# define __USE_FILE_OFFSET64    1
#endif
```

This time I think I will success, so I change my code like this:
```
    #define _FILE_OFFSET_BITS 64
    #include<stdio.h>

    FILE *fp = fopen("Thepure.y4m", "rb"); /* Largefile >= 2GB */
    perror("Error Info:");

    Error Info: Success
```
As I guess, it works!!! So when you encounter a problem in your code, keep thinking and you will figure it out!!!
